            <h1>About me</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="content">
                <p>Shortly after I started college, I had to put my education on hold
                    and
                    return
                    home to work and help my family. My first job was as an electrician’s assistant for an
                    independent company that worked with generator motors and building implants. I assisted
                    with
                    soldering and assembling electrical implants. <br><br>

                    My next job was working for a service group as a freelance waiter and bartender. It was
                    during
                    this time that I trained and acquired my strong social skills, while gaining valuable
                    experience
                    communicating in English, French, Spanish, German as well as my native language of
                    Italian.<br><br>

                    While working as a bartender and a waiter I was also working as a chemistry lab
                    technician
                    for
                    Legambiente. Legambiente is a company that promotes and enhances a wide variety of
                    production
                    actions with the goal of improving the quality of the environment. My responsibilities
                    as a
                    chemistry lab technician were to analyze water and food to find any trace of harmful
                    substances.
                    All that I had learned with my Chemistry Technician Diploma was put into action during
                    my
                    time
                    at Legambiente.<br><br>

                    In 2014 I started working for M3XP, which is a hardware laboratory in Sarno, Italy. I
                    managed to
                    accrue three years of work experience in the IT field working for this hardware and
                    software
                    company. I had the privilege of working for SawSystems in their Hardware Laboratory as
                    its
                    chief, where I learned valuable professional skills such as soldering, installing and
                    troubleshooting hardware and software for clients. In the meantime, I was also a
                    freelance
                    bilingual technician for companies and businesses and I was a private IT.<br><br>

                    In 2017 I attended three conventions for a SawSystems’ Start-up in Bologna, Berlin, and
                    Milan
                    where I spoke in Italian and English with potential financial lenders for the company’s
                    team. I
                    also had the job of translating the app and the app’s brochure from Italian to English
                    for
                    the
                    Berlin convention. Through the years I have been a translator for businesses,
                    acquaintances,
                    and
                    friends translating simultaneously between spoken and written Italian and
                    English.<br><br>

                    Working as a bilingual IT for the past five years has developed my troubleshooting
                    skills by
                    working with a variety of hardware and software for my clients. I have gained experience
                    with
                    installation and the use of software for accountants, lawyers, and factories. I have
                    developed
                    my knowledge of setting up, organizing, installing, and troubleshooting servers mounting
                    Microsoft software, Mac, and Linux Server distros operating systems. I have much
                    experience
                    setting up, organizing, and installing LAN connections, routers/modems as well as
                    troubleshooting connections problems. As an IT, I have the opportunity to travel to
                    clients’
                    place of business to make repairs, or assist clients remotely in addition to providing
                    tips
                    and
                    helping customers when they need to buy new hardware. I have created several websites
                    for
                    clients using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SASS. I also have experience with BootStrap 4,
                    VueJS,
                    and React frameworks.<br><br>

                    In my professional and personal life, I have been consistently praised as being
                    result-oriented
                    by my clients and peers. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional
                    projects,
                    I apply proven communication, language, and multitasking skills, which I will leverage
                    into
                    the
                    role at your company.<br><br>

                    After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and
                    competitive
                    candidate you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on how my specific skills
                    and
                    abilities will benefit your organization. Please contact me via email at
